# Arduino Dual AY MIDI detune
Project for Arduino ProMicro: MIDI synthesizer on two AY-3-8910 chips with detune functionality

Based on the project:
https://dogemicrosystems.ca/wiki/Dual_AY-3-8910_MIDI_module

Added functionality:
- support of MIDI pitch bend and modulation wheels
- button for switching working mode
- modes with detune (adding detuned the same note, octave up/down, 5th/7th)
- potentiometer for setting detune ratio

Fixed scheme for connecting MIDI input (see scheme_fix.png)
